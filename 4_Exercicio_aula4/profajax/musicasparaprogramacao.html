    These niggas is wildin' right now, like, these niggas is really wildin'<br>
    You know what I'm sayin'? Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, you heard?<br>
    Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G shit<br>
    You know what I'm saying? Gonorrhea, all of that shit<br>
    All of that shit<br>
    I catch all diseases in the world so the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?<br>
    G shit<br>
    <br>
    [Joey Badas$$]<br>
    I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb<br>
    They think you got a little buzz so now you can't get stung<br>
    I keep a razor blade tucked on me, runnin' my tongue<br>
    Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from<br>
    It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever<br>
    Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas<br>
    And bomb whatever<br>
    Say we don't move calmly never<br>
    This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella<br>
    Look, I could do this shit with no effort<br>
    No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records<br>
    Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture<br>
    Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta<br>
    No more free lectures, I'm taxing these niggas extra<br>
    This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector<br>
    So, might be best to protect your neck<br>
    Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya<br>
    <br>
    [XXXTENTACION]<br>
    Murder these flows like I murder these hoe ass niggas<br>
    Where the fuck is your energy bro?<br>
    Make your nigga deep throat a Desert Eagle<br>
    If he try me like a hoe, pussy boy that's on my soul<br>
    Make my flow shape shift, [?] expression like a facelift<br>
    I could probably [?] like eight grips, if you talking all that ape shit<br>
    I'm talking YM Bape shit, but I'm banging on my chest bitch<br>
    Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy<br>
    Traveling through the infinity, uh<br>
    You not that nigga you pretend to be, uh<br>
    All that bullshit do not get to me, uh<br>
    I am a spirit and entity, uh<br>
    You just wanna suck all my energy, uh<br>
    I am the realest since Kennedy, uh<br>
    These pussy niggas fucking suck, you sound the same<br>
    I spit the pain, that's why the young niggas feel the same<br>
    They know I bang, I pull a fucking pistol out the Range and act insane<br>
    <br>
    [XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]<br>
    Spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live<br>
    I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live<br>
    So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no -<br>
    I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    So I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live<br>
    I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more<br>
    I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live<br>
    So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more<br>

            • Bowtye's Verse •
    Pull up in the whip ridin’ soli<br>
    Dodgin’ all dem text<br>
    Watch dem slowly<br>
    I just want to plot how to stack this ravioli<br>
    Go these pshhh mad<br>
    Cause they really don’t know me<br>
    Wine can’t be fine <br>
    If it never sit lonely <br>
    A little bit of rest <br>
    So your face don’t look oldie<br>
    And you not movin’ round like a role poly,<br>
    Uh excuse me I gotta go<br>
    hold up<br>
            <br>
    •CHORUS•<br>
    I gotta save <br>
    Myself (Hey)<br>
    Cause I can't save<br>
    Anyone else (Hey) <br>
    I kinda gotta be selfish<br>
    With myself<br>
    I kinda gotta be selfish<br>
            <br>
    • Zilo's Verse •<br>
    Said I’m selfish <br>
    You been on some bullshit <br>
    I’m doing my own thing yeah<br>
    I can’t help it <br>
    If you’re getting jealous <br>
    That’s none of my business no <br>
    Hold your tongue don’t speak it<br>
    You should watch your tone, I told you I mean it <br>
    If you know what’s good you’ll keep your distance<br>
    I’m just tryna heal, yeah there’s no hard feelings <br>
    Hard feelings there’s no hard feelings <br>
    Shit ended from the beginning <br>
    Tough feeling what we’re both thinking <br>
    It seems like we had enough <br>
    Both quitting, then we start drinking <br>
    Both swimming then we start sinking <br>
    Tough hearing what both needed <br>
    It was time to cut it off<br>
            <br>
    •CHORUS•<br>
    I gotta save <br>
    Myself (Hey)<br>
    Cause I can't save<br>
    Anyone else (Hey) <br>
    I kinda gotta be selfish<br>
    With myself<br>
    I kinda gotta be selfish<br>
